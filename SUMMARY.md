# Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the changes made to the Highway DSL project, as well as instructions for future developers.

## Changes Made

1.  **Pydantic Migration:** The entire data model for the DSL, previously based on `dataclasses`, has been migrated to Pydantic `BaseModel`. This provides robust data validation, serialization, and deserialization capabilities.

2.  **Updated Usage Examples:** The `example_usage.py` script has been updated to reflect the new Pydantic-based models and their usage.

3.  **Comprehensive Unit and Integration Tests:** A comprehensive test suite has been developed using `pytest`, covering all aspects of the DSL, including model creation, workflow building, and serialization/deserialization to YAML and JSON. The project now has 100% test coverage.

4.  **Improved Project Structure:** The project has been restructured into a proper Python package by moving the core DSL logic into a `highway_dsl` directory. This improves module resolution and maintainability.

5.  **Type Checking with MyPy:** Static type checking has been enforced using `mypy`. All type errors have been resolved, ensuring a higher level of code quality.

6.  **Dependency Management:** Dependencies are now managed using `pyproject.toml`, with separate dependencies for the library and for development (testing, type checking).

7.  **Documentation:** A comprehensive `README.md` has been created, providing an overview of the project, features, installation instructions, usage examples, and development guidelines.

## Instructions for Future Developers

*   **Maintain 100% Test Coverage:** All new features and bug fixes must be accompanied by corresponding tests to maintain 100% code coverage.

*   **Adhere to Pydantic Models:** When adding or modifying data models, continue to use Pydantic `BaseModel` to ensure data consistency and validation.

*   **Follow Existing Code Style:** Maintain the existing code style and structure to ensure consistency throughout the project.

*   **Run Tests and Type Checking:** Before committing any changes, ensure that all tests pass (`pytest`) and that there are no type errors (`mypy .`).

*   **Update Documentation:** If any user-facing changes are made, update the `README.md` accordingly.
